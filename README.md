# Human-Pose-Standard-Description
This is the idea of a proposed standard for describing human poses, designed to be useful for training AI models and achieving better control of AI-generated content

## Standardized Human Pose Description System
This system provides a clear and unambiguous framework for describing human poses, ensuring that the position of a person and their body parts can be accurately understood even without a visual reference. It combines foundational postures, anatomical directional terms, and detailed limb descriptions to create precise and universally understood descriptions.

### 1. Foundational Postures
These terms define the primary orientation of the entire body relative to the ground.

Standing: The person is upright, bearing weight on their feet.

Kneeling: The person is supported by one or both knees.

Laying: The person is resting horizontally on a surface.

  Prone: Lying on the anterior (stomach) side of the body.

  Supine: Lying on the posterior (back) side of the body.

  Lateral: Lying on either the left or right lateral side of the body.

Inverted: The person's head is positioned inferior to their hips. This can be further specified by support:

  Handstand: Supported by the hands.

  Headstand: Supported by the head.

### 2. Anatomical Directional Terms
These terms are crucial for unambiguous descriptions and are always relative to the standard anatomical position (standing upright, feet together, palms facing forward), regardless of the person's actual pose.

  Anterior (Ventral): Towards the front of the body (e.g., chest, stomach).

  Posterior (Dorsal): Towards the back of the body (e.g., spine, back). 

  Superior (Cranial): Towards the head.

  Inferior (Caudal): Towards the feet.

  Medial: Towards the midline of the body.

  Lateral: Away from the midline of the body.

### 3. Major Body Area Orientation
These describe the position and orientation of the core body areas.

#### Head

  Lateral (Left/Right): Head turned to the left or right side.

  Tilted (Left/Right): Ear moving towards the shoulder.

  Flexed (Downward): Chin moving towards the chest.

#### Torso

  Upright: Torso is vertically aligned.

  Flexed (Anterior): Torso bent forward.

  Twisted (Left/Right): Rotation of the torso around its vertical axis.

  Lateral Flexion (Left/Right): Torso bending sideways.

#### Hips

  Adducted (Closed): Legs are close together, towards the midline.

  Abducted (Spread): Legs are moved away from the midline.

  Fully Abducted (Fully Spread): Legs are at their maximum spread (e.g., in a split).

  Flexed: Thighs are lifted towards the torso (e.g., sitting).

  Extended: Thighs are moved backward from a flexed position (e.g., standing upright).

### 4. Limb Positions
Limb positions are described segment by segment, using anatomical terms to specify direction and angle.

Arms (Upper Arm, Forearm, Hand)

#### Upper Arm (at shoulder joint): 
  Adducted, Abducted (Lateral)
  Flexed (Anterior), Extended (Posterior)
  Superior (Overhead)
  Horizontal Abduction/Adduction.

#### Forearm (at elbow joint): 
  Fully Extended
  Flexed 90°
  Fully Flexed
  Pronated
  Supinated.

#### Hand (at wrist joint): 
  Neutral
  Flexed (Palmarflexion)
  Extended (Dorsiflexion)
  Ulnar Deviation
  Radial Deviation
  Fisted
  Open.

Legs (Thigh, Lower Leg, Foot)

#### Thigh (at hip joint): 
  Adducted,
  Abducted,
  Flexed,
  Extended,
  Medial Rotation,
  Lateral Rotation.
  
#### Lower Leg (at knee joint): 
  Fully Extended,
  Flexed 90°,
  Fully Flexed.

#### Foot (at ankle joint):
  Plantarflexed,
  Dorsiflexed,
  Inverted,
  Everted,
  Planted,
  Tip-toed.

## 5. Clarifying Spatial Relationships
When describing the position of objects relative to a person, always use the anatomical directional terms to avoid ambiguity from different viewing angles.

Example: A person is Laying Prone (on their stomach).

To describe something on their back: "A dog is resting on the person's posterior torso."

To describe something at their feet: "A blanket is positioned inferior to the person's lower legs."

To describe something to their side: "A book is placed lateral to the person's right arm."

By consistently applying these terms, you can create highly precise and universally understood descriptions of human poses and their surrounding environment.
